#Learning Dart Basics
Dart is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, has a class-based style, and uses a C-style syntax. If you are familiar with the C#, C++, Swift, Kotlin, and Java/JavaScript languages, you will be able to start developing in Dart quickly. Dart is a straightforward language to learn, and you can get started relatively quickly. This chapter covered the basics of the Dart language. I learned how to comment the code for better readability and how to use the main() function that starts the app. I learned how to declare variables to reference different kinds of values such as numbers, strings, Booleans, lists, and more. I used the List to store an array of filters and learned how to iterate through each value. The operator symbols commonly used to perform arithmetic, equality, logical, conditional, and cascade notation. The cascade notation is a powerful operator to make multiple sequence calls on the same object such as scaling and translating (positioning) an object.
